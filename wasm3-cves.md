# Testing Fil-C with Real CVEs in wasm3

I was looking for a WebAssembly interpreter to build with Fil-C, and I found [wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3). It's simple, portable C, easy to build, should work fine.

But wasm3 has been unmaintained for quite some time. The wasm3 package in nixpkgs is marked as insecure because it has several unfixed CVEs. You can't even try to run it without changing your Nix configuration.

Well, okay. That's a good chance to really try Fil-C, though!
It is, after all, the whole point of Fil-C: to crash loudly when invalid things happen, rather than silently corrupting memory or letting attackers do whatever they want.

So let's try to build Wasm3 with Fil-C, run it with CVE crash payloads, and see what happens!

## Building wasm3 with Fil-C

I added wasm3 to my Nix flake like this:

```nix
wasm3 =
  filenv.mkDerivation {
    src = wasm3-src;
    pname = "wasm3";
    version = "0.5.1";
    enableParallelBuilding = true;
    nativeBuildInputs = with base; [
      cmake ninja
    ];
    cmakeFlags = ["-DBUILD_WASI=simple"];
  };
```

There `filenv` is a variant of the standard Nix `stdenv` whose C/C++ toolchain has been swapped with a Fil-C toolchain.

The build command `nix build .#wasm3` worked without any changes or tweaks except changing the `BUILD_WASI` parameter from the default, which wants to fetch some external runtime, to either `none` or `simple`. The CVEs expect a WASI environment so pick `simple`.

## Testing CVE-2022-39974: Out-of-Bounds Read

This CVE is about an out-of-bounds read in the `op_Select_i32_srs` operation. In normal wasm3, it causes a segfault. I grabbed the PoC from [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3/issues/379):

```bash
$ curl -L -o cve-2022-39974.wasm.gz \
  "https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3/files/9441091/op_Select_i32_srs.wasm.gz"
$ gunzip cve-2022-39974.wasm.gz
$ ./result/bin/wasm3 cve-2022-39974.wasm
```

And here's what happened:

```
filc safety error: cannot read pointer with ptr >= upper.
    pointer: 0x7e5039350f90,0x7e5015781210,0x7e5015791220
    expected 4 bytes.

    <runtime>: start_program
[3310720] filc panic: thwarted a futile attempt to violate memory safety.
Trace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)
```

Oh my! A pointer read safety violation! The pointer `0x7e5039350f90` tried to read beyond its upper bound. Fil-C caught it at the exact operation that causes the CVE (`op_Select_i32_srs`), printed a full stack trace, and stopped execution.

## Testing CVE-2022-34529: Slot Index Integer Overflow

This one involves an integer overflow in slot index calculation. In standard wasm3, this leads to memory corruption and potential RCE. Got the PoC from [this issue](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3/issues/337):

```bash
$ curl -L -o cve-2022-34529.wasm.zip \
  "https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3/files/8939432/poc.wasm.zip"
$ unzip cve-2022-34529.wasm.zip
$ ./result/bin/wasm3 poc.wasm
```

Output:

```
filc safety error: cannot read pointer with ptr < lower.
    pointer: 0x754f1ef76590,0x754fd8581210,0x754fd8591220
    expected 4 bytes.
semantic origin:
    <somewhere>: op_MemFill

    <somewhere>: op_MemFill
    <somewhere>: op_SetRegister_i32
    <somewhere>: op_f32_Ceil_s
    <somewhere>: op_Entry
    <somewhere>: m3_CallArgv
    <somewhere>: repl_call
    <somewhere>: main
    ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16: __libc_start_call_main
    ../csu/libc-start.c:161:3: __libc_start_main
    <runtime>: start_program
[3310747] filc panic: thwarted a futile attempt to violate memory safety.
Trace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)
```

This time: "cannot read pointer with ptr < lower" â€” the pointer underflowed! The integer overflow wrapped around and produced a negative offset, which Fil-C caught before any memory corruption could occur.

Thwarted again!

## What This Means

Fil-C can **provably thwart these real CVEs in a real program**. These are actual exploits from actual security vulnerabilities that crash or exploit normal wasm3 builds.

You get the exact location where the violation happened (`op_Select_i32_srs`, `op_MemFill`), the full call stack, and the precise nature of the violation (pointer out of upper bound, pointer below lower bound).

Now this flake exposes Wasm3 as an ordinary package without marking it as insecure. Not because I'm reckless, and not because we fixed the bugs in the source code, and certainly not because we rewrote it in Rust... but because Fil-C protects it!

## Try It Yourself

If you have Nix with flakes enabled, just run:

```bash
nix develop github:mbrock/filnix#wasm3-cve-test
```

This drops you into a shell with:

- Fil-C-compiled wasm3 in your PATH
- The CVE exploit files ready to run
- A helpful banner showing what to do

Then just try:

```bash
wasm3 cve-2022-39974.wasm
wasm3 cve-2022-34529.wasm
```

[Fil-C](https://fil-c.org/) is very cool. Give it a try!
