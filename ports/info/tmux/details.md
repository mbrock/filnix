# tmux v3.5a

## Summary
The tmux patch contains only autotools infrastructure files with no actual Fil-C compatibility changes to C source code.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
None - no C/C++ source code modifications.

## Build Artifact Bloat
Entire patch (5832 lines) consists of build artifacts:
- `etc/compile` (348 lines) - Automake compiler wrapper script
- `etc/config.guess` (1748+ lines) - Platform detection script  
- `etc/config.sub` (likely remainder) - Platform name normalization

All three files are standard autotools infrastructure that should be generated during build, not checked into source control or included in patches.

## Assessment
- **Patch quality**: Excessive bloat - 100% unnecessary artifacts
- **Actual changes**: None
- **Recommendation**: This patch should be empty or removed entirely. These scripts should be excluded with patterns like `etc/compile`, `etc/config.{guess,sub}`
