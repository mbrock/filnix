# toybox v8.12

## Summary
The toybox patch contains only build configuration and Kconfig infrastructure with no Fil-C compatibility changes to C source code.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
None - no C/C++ source code modifications.

## Build Artifact Bloat
Entire patch (5447 lines) consists of:
- `good-config` (393 lines) - Kconfig build configuration file listing enabled features
- `kconfig/conf.c` (624+ lines) - Kconfig configuration utility source
- Additional kconfig infrastructure files

These are build system files, not Fil-C compatibility patches. The `good-config` file is project-specific build configuration, while kconfig files are infrastructure for menuconfig-style builds.

## Assessment
- **Patch quality**: Excessive bloat - 100% build system artifacts
- **Actual changes**: None
- **Recommendation**: This patch should be empty or removed. Build configurations should be generated/selected at build time, not hard-coded in patches. Exclude with patterns like `*-config`, `kconfig/*`
