# Linux Kernel v6.10.5

## Summary
Large refactoring of VMware graphics drivers and kernel utility code with Fil-C compatibility changes to pointer arithmetic and red-black tree implementation.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes

### VMware Graphics Driver (vmwgfx)
- Major simplification: removed dumb buffer surface tracking, detached resource management
- Removed XArray-based resource tracking
- Simplified buffer release paths

### Kernel Utilities (tools/)
- **tools/include/linux/compiler.h**: Replaced type-punning `__may_alias__` casts with `zmemmove()` for safe memory copying
- **tools/include/linux/rbtree.h**: Changed `__rb_parent_color` from `unsigned long` to `struct rb_node *` pointer
- **tools/include/linux/rbtree_augmented.h**: Added casts to `unsigned long` when extracting color bits from pointer
- **tools/lib/rbtree.c**: Updated pointer arithmetic to use pointer types directly

## Build Artifact Bloat
None - this is pure source code changes.

## Assessment
- Patch quality: Clean refactoring, no bloat
- Actual changes: Substantial (major driver simplification + kernel utility compatibility fixes)
