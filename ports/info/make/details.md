# GNU Make v4.4.1

## Summary
Single targeted bounds check added to prevent out-of-bounds access when parsing environment variables.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
- **src/expand.c**: 
  - Include `<stdfil.h>` header
  - Add `zinbounds(&(*ep)[nl])` check before accessing `(*ep)[nl]` when iterating environment variables
  - Prevents potential out-of-bounds access when checking for `=` separator in environment strings

## Build Artifact Bloat
None - single source file modification.

## Assessment
- Patch quality: Minimal, surgical fix
- Actual changes: Minor (single bounds check for safety)
