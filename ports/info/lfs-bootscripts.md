# LFS Bootscripts 20240825

## Summary
System configuration changes for debugging and runtime directory setup - not Fil-C compatibility per se, but operational requirements.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes

**Note**: These aren't technically Fil-C compatibility changes, but operational/debugging configuration for running Fil-C binaries in LFS environment.

### Runtime directory creation (lfs/init.d/mountvirtfs)
- **Added**: `mkdir -m 1777 /run/user || failed=1`
- Creates `/run/user` with sticky bit + full permissions (1777)
- Standard location for user-specific runtime files
- Required by many modern applications (systemd convention)

### Core dump configuration (lfs/lib/services/init-functions)
- **Added**: `ulimit -c unlimited`
- Enables unlimited core dump size
- Critical for debugging Fil-C programs
- Allows full memory dumps when programs crash

## Build Artifact Bloat
None - these are configuration scripts, not build artifacts.

## Assessment
- **Patch quality**: Minimal - two targeted changes
- **Actual changes**: None - these are system configuration, not code changes
- **Purpose**: 
  - Core dumps essential for debugging memory safety issues
  - /run/user directory standard requirement for modern Linux systems
- **Classification**: Operational configuration rather than Fil-C compatibility
  - Could be applied to any LFS system
  - Not specific to Fil-C's memory safety features
