# TCL 8.6.15

## Summary
No actual Fil-C compatibility changes. After filtering prebuilt binaries and common build artifacts, the remaining patch contains library files, Windows resources, and build helpers that are part of the git history.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
None.

## Remaining Artifacts (after filtering)

**Library files (2 files):**
- `library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl`
- `library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl`

**Build artifacts:**
- `tools/encoding/Makefile`

**Windows resources (4 files):**
- `win/coffbase.txt`
- `win/tclsh.exe.manifest.in`
- `win/tclsh.ico`
- `win/tclsh.rc`

These appear to be generated or platform-specific files that were committed during development but aren't actual code changes.

## What Was Filtered Out

The original 5377-line patch included:
- Prebuilt zlib binaries for Windows (win32, win64, win64-arm): `.dll`, `.lib` files
- Vendored zlib Makefiles in `compat/zlib/`
- Generated documentation: `doc/tclsh.1`, `tools/tclsh.svg`
- Configure fragments: `unix/config.status.lineno`

These are now excluded by the patch extraction script.

## Assessment
- **Patch quality**: No code changes, only development artifacts
- **Actual changes**: None
- **Conclusion**: TCL 8.6.15 appears to build cleanly with Fil-C without modifications
