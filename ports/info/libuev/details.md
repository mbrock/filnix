# libuev 2.4.1

## Summary
No actual Fil-C compatibility changes. After filtering autotools artifacts, the remaining patch contains Debian packaging, documentation, and an autogen script.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
None.

## Remaining Artifacts (after filtering)

**Debian packaging (14 files):**
- `debian/*` - Complete Debian package configuration

**Documentation:**
- `doc/HACKING.md`
- `doc/TODO.md`
- `src/README.md` (appears twice in patch - likely modification)

**Build script:**
- `autogen.sh` - Autotools bootstrap script

## What Was Filtered Out

The original 18,290-line patch was 99% autotools bloat:
- `aux/` directory with ar-lib, compile, ltmain.sh, config.guess/sub, etc.
- Thousands of lines of generated autotools helper scripts

These are now filtered by the patch extraction script, reducing the patch from 18KB to 823 lines.

## Assessment
- **Patch quality**: No code changes
- **Actual changes**: None
- **Conclusion**: libuev 2.4.1 builds cleanly with Fil-C without modifications
- **Note**: The remaining files are development infrastructure (Debian packaging, docs) rather than source code changes
