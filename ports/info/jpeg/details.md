# JPEG 6b

## Summary
Single alignment fix and removal of binary test files from repository.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
- **jmemmgr.c**: Alignment type change
  - Changed `#define ALIGN_TYPE  void*` to `#define ALIGN_TYPE  double`
  - Ensures memory blocks align to double (8-byte) boundaries instead of pointer size
  - More conservative alignment for Fil-C's memory model
  - Prevents potential alignment violations with stricter capability bounds

## Build Artifact Bloat
Binary files removed (proper cleanup):
- `IMG_6752-crop-hi.jpg` (deleted binary)
- `IMG_6752-crop-hi.ppm` (deleted binary)
- `rose2.jpg` (deleted binary)

These are test/sample images that shouldn't be in patch.

## Assessment
- **Patch quality**: Minimal - one essential change plus cleanup
- **Actual changes**: Minor but important
  - Alignment change prevents subtle memory corruption
  - Double alignment is stricter and safer than pointer alignment
- **Binary removal**: Good practice - keeps patch focused on code changes
