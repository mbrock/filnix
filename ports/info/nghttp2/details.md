# nghttp2 1.62.1

## Summary
No actual Fil-C compatibility changes. After filtering common build artifacts, the remaining patch contains only m4 macro files that are part of the autotools build system.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
None.

## Remaining Artifacts (after filtering)

**m4 macros (3 files):**
- `m4/ax_check_compile_flag.m4`
- `m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4`
- `m4/libxml2.m4`

These are autoconf macro definitions used during `./configure`.

## What Was Filtered Out

The original 18,836-line patch was almost entirely build artifacts:
- `INSTALL` file
- Autotools helper scripts: `compile`, `config.guess`, `config.sub`, `depcomp`, `install-sh`, `ltmain.sh`, `missing`, `test-driver`
- These constituted >95% of the patch

Now only the m4 macros remain (1298 lines).

## Assessment
- **Patch quality**: No code changes
- **Actual changes**: None
- **Conclusion**: nghttp2 1.62.1 builds cleanly with Fil-C without modifications
