# nghttp2 v1.62.1

## Summary
This patch contains NO actual code changes - it's entirely build system artifacts.

## Fil-C Compatibility Changes
None.

## Build Artifact Bloat
Extremely bloated - consists ENTIRELY of build artifacts:

- **INSTALL**: New 368-line generic autotools installation instructions file
- **compile**: New 348-line autotools wrapper script
- **Massive amounts of additional content**: The patch was truncated showing 8279+ omitted lines, all appearing to be autotools/libtool build infrastructure

### Exclusion Recommendations
- Exclude: `INSTALL`, `compile`, and all other autotools-generated files
- Pattern: `INSTALL`, `compile`, `config.guess`, `config.sub`, `ltmain.sh`, `*.m4`, etc.

## Assessment
- Patch quality: Excessive bloat - 100% unnecessary files
- Actual changes: **NONE** - this patch should be completely excluded or regenerated from source
